# HelvetiForma Complete Setup Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved!

The issue was that the WordPress functions.php file wasn't loaded, so the ACF fields weren't being displayed in the admin columns. I've created a complete WordPress plugin that handles everything.

## 📦 New Plugin: `helvetiforma-complete-automation.zip`

This plugin includes:
- ✅ **Admin columns** showing access level and price
- ✅ **Webhook automation** for real-time sync
- ✅ **WooCommerce product creation** 
- ✅ **Admin interface** for testing and management

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### 1. Install the WordPress Plugin

1. **Download the plugin:**
   - File: `helvetiforma-complete-automation.zip` (3.6 KB)
   - Location: `/Users/damien/Documents/Oksan/helvetiforma_combine/helvetiforma_v3/helvetiforma-complete-automation.zip`

2. **Upload to WordPress:**
   - Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New
   - Click "Upload Plugin"
   - Choose `helvetiforma-complete-automation.zip`
   - Click "Install Now" → "Activate Plugin"

### 2. Configure the Plugin

1. **Go to Tools → HelvetiForma Automation**
2. **Test the webhook** by clicking "Test Webhook"
3. **Check the status** - should show "✓ Active"

### 3. Test the System

1. **Edit an article** (like "test" - ID 4570)
2. **Set access_level to "premium"**
3. **Set price to 25**
4. **Save the article**
5. **Check the posts list** - "Niveau d'accès" should now show "💎 Premium"
6. **Check WooCommerce** - a product should be created automatically

## 🔧 What the Plugin Does

### Admin Columns
- **Niveau d'accès**: Shows 🌐 Public, 👥 Membres, or 💎 Premium
- **Prix (CHF)**: Shows the price or "Gratuit"
- **Produit WooCommerce**: Shows if a product exists or "⚠ À synchroniser"

### Automation
- **Real-time sync**: When you save an article, it automatically creates/updates WooCommerce products
- **Webhook integration**: Sends data to your Next.js app
- **Bulk sync**: Can sync all articles at once

### Admin Interface
- **Test webhook**: Verify the connection works
- **Sync single article**: Test with specific articles
- **Sync all articles**: Bulk operation
- **Statistics**: See how many articles are premium, synced, etc.

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Admin Columns
1. Go to Posts → All Posts
2. Edit the "test" article (ID 4570)
3. Set access_level to "premium" and price to 25
4. Save the article
5. Go back to Posts list
6. **Expected**: "Niveau d'accès" should show "💎 Premium"

### Test 2: WooCommerce Integration
1. After setting premium + price, save the article
2. Go to WooCommerce → Products
3. **Expected**: Find a product with SKU "article-4570" and price 25 CHF

### Test 3: Next.js Integration
1. The webhook should automatically send data to your Next.js app
2. Check your Next.js logs for webhook activity
3. **Expected**: Article should be available for purchase in your Next.js app

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Admin Columns Don't Show
1. Make sure the plugin is activated
2. Check if there are any PHP errors in WordPress
3. Try refreshing the posts list page

### If WooCommerce Products Aren't Created
1. Check the webhook status in Tools → HelvetiForma Automation
2. Look at WordPress error logs for webhook errors
3. Verify WooCommerce is active and API credentials are correct

### If ACF Fields Don't Save
1. Make sure ACF plugin is installed and active
2. Check that the field group is assigned to "Posts"
3. Verify the field names are exactly "access_level" and "price"

## 📊 Expected Results

After installing the plugin and setting an article to premium:

### WordPress Admin
- Posts list shows "💎 Premium" in the access level column
- Price shows "25.00 CHF" in the price column
- WooCommerce status shows "✓ Produit créé" with product ID
