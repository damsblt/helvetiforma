# Course Checkout Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The course checkout flow was creating WooCommerce orders with **0 CHF** and enrollments were stuck in **"Pending"** status.

### Root Causes

1. **PHP Syntax Error in `functions.php`**:
   - Lines 27-35 had a broken function definition
   - `wp_enqueue_style()` was placed OUTSIDE the function body
   - This prevented the entire `functions.php` from loading properly

2. **Missing Line Items in WooCommerce Orders**:
   - The Next.js enrollment API (`src/app/api/tutor-lms/enrollments/route.ts`) was creating WooCommerce orders WITHOUT the course product as a line item
   - This meant:
     - ✅ Order was created (#3837, #3839)
     - ❌ Order had **0 CHF** (no products in cart)
     - ❌ WordPress hooks didn't trigger enrollment (no products = no course to enroll in)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `functions.php` (PHP Side)

**File**: `wordpress-functions-CORRECTED-FINAL.php`

- ✅ Corrected the `twentytwentyfive_enqueue_styles()` function syntax
- ✅ Added missing `/tutor/v1/check-enrollment` REST API endpoint
- ✅ Kept all TutorLMS auto-enrollment hooks intact

**To Apply**: Replace your WordPress theme's `functions.php` with this corrected version.

### 2. Fixed Enrollment API (Next.js Side)

**File**: `src/app/api/tutor-lms/enrollments/route.ts`

**Key Changes**:

1. **Fetch the course's linked WooCommerce product ID**:
   ```typescript
   const courseResponse = await fetch(
     `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL}/wp-json/tutor/v1/courses/${courseId}`,
     { headers: { 'Authorization': `Basic ${TUTOR_AUTH}` } }
   );
   const course = await courseResponse.json();
   const productId = course.meta._tutor_course_product_id;
   ```

2. **Create WooCommerce order WITH course product as line item**:
   ```typescript
   const orderData = {
     customer_id: parseInt(actualUserId),
     payment_method: 'stripe',
     set_paid: true,
     status: 'completed',
     line_items: [
       {
         product_id: parseInt(productId),
         quantity: 1
       }
     ],
     // ... billing info, meta data
   };
   ```

3. **Let WordPress hooks handle enrollment automatically**:
   - Removed manual TutorLMS API enrollment call
   - The `HelvetiForma_Tutor_Auto_Enrollment` class in `functions.php` now handles enrollment when the WooCommerce order is completed
   - Added a 2-second wait for hooks to process

## Expected Flow After Fix

1. **User completes Stripe payment** → Payment Intent succeeds
2. **Next.js enrollment API is called** → Fetches course → Gets linked product ID
3. **WooCommerce order is created** → WITH course product as line item → Order total = 30 CHF ✅
4. **WordPress hook triggers** → `woocommerce_order_status_completed` 
5. **`HelvetiForma_Tutor_Auto_Enrollment` runs** → Finds course ID from product ID
6. **TutorLMS enrollment is created** → Status = `'completed'` (auto-approved) ✅
7. **User is redirected to dashboard** → Can access course content immediately ✅

## Testing Instructions

1. **Update WordPress `functions.php`**:
   - Navigate to: WordPress Admin → Appearance → Theme File Editor → `functions.php`
   - Replace with contents from `wordpress-functions-CORRECTED-FINAL.php`
   - Click "Update File"

2. **Verify the Next.js changes**:
   - Changes are already applied to `src/app/api/tutor-lms/enrollments/route.ts`
   - Restart your Next.js server if needed

3. **Test the flow**:
   1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/courses/charges-sociales-test-123-2`
   2. Click "Acheter la formation" button
   3. Login or register
   4. Complete checkout with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   5. Verify:
      - ✅ WooCommerce order shows **30 CHF** (not 0 CHF)
      - ✅ Email notification shows **30 CHF**
      - ✅ Enrollment status is **"Completed"** (not "Pending")
      - ✅ User can access course immediately
      - ✅ Redirect to dashboard works

## Files Modified

1. `wordpress-functions-CORRECTED-FINAL.php` (NEW - to replace WordPress `functions.php`)
2. `src/app/api/tutor-lms/enrollments/route.ts` (UPDATED)

## Files to Upload to WordPress

**Option 1: Update `functions.php` directly in WordPress**
- Copy contents of `wordpress-functions-CORRECTED-FINAL.php`
- Paste into WordPress Theme File Editor

**Option 2: Upload via FTP/SFTP**
- Upload `wordpress-functions-CORRECTED-FINAL.php` as `functions.php` to your theme directory
- Path: `/wp-content/themes/twentytwentyfive/functions.php`

## Notes

- The PHP syntax error was preventing ALL custom functions from loading
- This is why both the price (0 CHF) and enrollment (Pending) were broken
- With both fixes applied, the entire flow should work correctly
- The WooCommerce + TutorLMS integration is now properly configured

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying fixes:

1. **Check WordPress error logs** for PHP errors
2. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
3. **Check server console** for Next.js API logs
4. **Verify environment variables**:
   - `TUTOR_API_KEY`
   - `TUTOR_SECRET_KEY`
   - `WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY`
   - `WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET`
