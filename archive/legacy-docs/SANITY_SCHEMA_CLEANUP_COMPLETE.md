# Sanity Schema Cleanup Complete

## Overview
Successfully removed Post, Achat (Purchase), and Utilisateur (User) schemas from Sanity since these are now managed via WordPress/WooCommerce.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Files Deleted
- ✅ `sanity/schemaTypes/postType.ts` - Post schema definition
- ✅ `sanity/schemaTypes/purchase.ts` - Purchase schema definition  
- ✅ `sanity/schemaTypes/user.ts` - User schema definition

### 2. Schema Index Updated
- ✅ Updated `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` to remove references to deleted schemas
- ✅ Added comments explaining the migration to WordPress

### 3. Sanity Scripts Cleaned
- ✅ Deleted `sanity/scripts/deploy-purchase-schema.js`
- ✅ Deleted `sanity/scripts/check-article-content.js`
- ✅ Deleted `sanity/scripts/fix-test2-post.js`

### 4. Application Code Updated
- ✅ Updated `src/app/(site)/admin/users/page.tsx` - Now shows WordPress migration notice
- ✅ Updated `src/app/(site)/admin/purchases/page.tsx` - Now shows WooCommerce migration notice
- ✅ Updated `src/app/(site)/admin/page.tsx` - Updated stats to show WordPress/WooCommerce management
- ✅ Deleted `src/app/api/sanity/webhook/route.ts` - No longer needed for post webhooks

### 5. Types Regenerated
- ✅ Ran `npx sanity typegen generate` to update TypeScript types
- ✅ Generated types for 13 remaining schema types

## Current Sanity Schema
Only the following schemas remain in Sanity:
- `page` - For managing website pages
- Other content schemas as needed

## Migration Status
- **Users**: Now managed via WordPress user system
- **Posts/Articles**: Now managed via WordPress posts
- **Purchases/Orders**: Now managed via WooCommerce
- **Content Pages**: Still managed via Sanity

## Next Steps
1. Verify that all WordPress/WooCommerce integrations are working correctly
2. Test that admin pages show proper migration notices
3. Ensure no broken references remain in the codebase

## Files Modified
- `sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts`
- `src/app/(site)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(site)/admin/purchases/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(site)/admin/page.tsx`
- `sanity/sanity.types.ts` (regenerated)

## Files Deleted
- `sanity/schemaTypes/postType.ts`
- `sanity/schemaTypes/purchase.ts`
- `sanity/schemaTypes/user.ts`
- `sanity/scripts/deploy-purchase-schema.js`
- `sanity/scripts/check-article-content.js`
- `sanity/scripts/fix-test2-post.js`
- `src/app/api/sanity/webhook/route.ts`

The cleanup is complete and the application now properly reflects that users, posts, and purchases are managed via WordPress/WooCommerce instead of Sanity.
