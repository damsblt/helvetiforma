# 🔧 Stripe Integration Debug Solution

## ❌ **Current Issue**
The TutorLMS checkout page shows "Page de checkout en cours de configuration..." because:
1. TutorLMS needs courses to be linked to WooCommerce products
2. Our custom Stripe integration has errors

## ✅ **Solution: Fix Our Custom Checkout**

Since TutorLMS checkout isn't properly configured, let's fix our custom checkout system.

### **The Real Problem**
The Stripe error `{}` suggests the Stripe Elements aren't properly configured. Let me create a working solution.

## 🚀 **Quick Fix**

Let me create a simplified, working Stripe checkout that will definitely work:

1. **Use Stripe Checkout Sessions** instead of Elements
2. **Simpler integration** that's more reliable
3. **Proper error handling**

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/courses/charges-sociales-test-123-2/checkout`
2. You should see the course checkout form
3. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Check console for detailed error messages

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

I'll implement a more reliable Stripe integration using Checkout Sessions instead of Elements, which should resolve the payment issues.
