# Course Checkout Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Payment Intent Creation
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/payment/course-payment-intent`
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Test Result**: Successfully creates Stripe payment intents with correct metadata

### 2. Course Data Loading
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/wordpress/courses/[id]`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed to accept both numeric IDs and slugs
- **Test Result**: Successfully loads course data by slug

### 3. Enrollment Storage
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/tutor-lms/enrollments`
- **Status**: ✅ Working with local file storage
- **Uses**: `enrollment-tracker.ts` for persistent storage

### 4. Course Purchase Recording
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/wordpress/course-purchase`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Creates**: WooCommerce orders for tracking

## 🔴 What Needs Testing

### 1. Frontend Payment Flow
- **Issue**: Payment intents are created but not confirmed
- **Reason**: Requires manual testing with actual Stripe card input
- **To Test**: 
  1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/courses/charges-sociales-test-123-2/checkout`
  2. Login as a user
  3. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  4. Submit payment form
  5. Check browser console for debugging logs

### 2. WooCommerce Order Creation
- **Issue**: Orders should be created after successful payment
- **Status**: Implementation exists but needs testing
- **Triggered by**: Successful payment → enrollment API → course-purchase API

### 3. Complete User Journey
```
User clicks "Acheter la formation"
  ↓
Redirects to /courses/[slug]/checkout (with auth check)
  ↓
Payment intent created automatically
  ↓
User enters card details (Stripe Elements)
  ↓
User submits form
  ↓
Stripe confirms payment (frontend)
  ↓
Payment success → calls enrollment API
  ↓
Enrollment API:
  - Verifies payment with Stripe
  - Records purchase in WooCommerce
  - Stores enrollment locally
  ↓
Success message → redirect to course page
```
